  <p>He came upon a dog with a backpack on. The penguin said,"Have thouest any food kindly dog?"<br>The dog said, "Yes, but you must give me an egg".<br>The penguin said, "I'm a guy."<br>The dog said,"I know the male penguin carries the eggs."<br>Penguin said,"Fine."The penguin took out his eggs and "accidently" made them fall towards a bunch of rocks. Then he went and collected them all and handed the dog an egg. The dog handed the penguin some fish and said, "Thanks for the egg." The penguin said,"no problem"then quickly took off.  <img src="http://assets1.thelastocean.co.nz/assets/Adelie-with-rock_2_N.jpg"style="width:30%"> Later the dog tried to eat the egg and realized it was a rock.</p>
